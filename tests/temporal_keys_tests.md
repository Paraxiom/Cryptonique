# Running the `test_temporal_key_generation_and_validation` Test

## How to Run the Test

To run the `test_temporal_key_generation_and_validation` test in your Rust project, follow these instructions:

1. **Open the Terminal**: 
   Ensure you are in the root directory of your Rust project, where the `Cargo.toml` file is located.

2. **Execute the Test Command**: 
   In the terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test test_temporal_key_generation_and_validation

This command compiles your code and runs the specific test named test_temporal_key_generation_and_validation.
Understanding the Test
Objective

The test_temporal_key_generation_and_validation is designed to ensure that the process of generating, storing, and validating a temporal key works as expected. It particularly focuses on the correct generation of a key, its storage in shared state, and the validation of its associated timestamp.
Steps in the Test

    Initialization:
    The test initializes the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model and a shared state structure to simulate an environment where the key will be used.

    Key Generation:
    It generates a temporal key of a specified length (256 bytes) using a pseudo-random number generator. The key is designed to be compatible with the system's encryption or transformation functions.

    Storing the Key:
    The generated key, along with its generation timestamp, is stored in the shared state. This step mimics the saving of the key in a system where it may be accessed later.

    Retrieving and Validating the Key:
    The test then retrieves the key and its timestamp from the shared state and checks if the key's age (time since its generation) is within an expected validity period (defined by evolution_interval).

    Asserting Timestamp Consistency:
    Finally, the test asserts that the timestamp retrieved from the shared state matches the key's original generation time. This is a crucial check to ensure the key's timestamp remains unaltered through the process of storage and retrieval, maintaining the integrity of the system's temporal key management.

Test Outcome

    Pass: If the test passes, it confirms that the temporal key's generation, storage, retrieval, and validation processes are functioning correctly in the simulated environment.
    Fail: If the test fails, it indicates a potential issue in the key management process, which needs to be investigated and resolved to maintain system integrity.
