src/htm/layers/input_layer.rs and output_layer.rs:

    These files represent the layers of the HTM system. The input layer handles the initial processing of data, while the output layer (which needs implementation) would handle the final output of the system. The layers are where the interaction between columns (and thus cells and synapses) takes place.

scalar_encoder.rs:

    The encoder translates real-world data into a format that the HTM system can process (SDRs). It's a crucial interface between the HTM system and the data it processes.

src/htm/htm_model.rs and src/htm/htm_system.rs:

    These files likely contain the overarching logic that ties together all the components of the HTM system. They might manage the overall process flow, learning, and pattern recognition.

noise_generation.rs and learning.rs:

    After establishing the core HTM functionality, focus on these files. They seem to handle more specialized aspects of the system, like introducing noise to the SDRs and adapting the system over time through learning algorithms.

anomaly_check.rs:

    Finally, look at this file. Anomaly detection is typically an advanced feature in HTM systems, applied after the core functionalities (like encoding, spatial pooling, and temporal memory) are in place and working.
