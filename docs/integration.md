    Temporal Key Generation and Validation
        Generate a temporal key using the pseudo-random number generator seeded with the current time.
        Validate the key's timestamp in the SharedState and ensure it matches the expected validity period.

    Spatial Encoding and Decoding
        Take a data block and apply spatial encoding using topographical mapping and FFT.
        Decode the data block and ensure it matches the original data.

    Feistel Network and HTM Model Integration
        Encrypt a data block using a Feistel network and an evolving key from the HTM model.
        Decrypt the data block and verify its integrity.

    Quantum Oracle and Classical System Compatibility
        Use Deutsch's Algorithm to generate a key or some data transformation parameters.
        Apply these in a classical encryption scheme like the Feistel network and validate the results.

    Chaotic Map and HTM Key Evolution
        Initialize the system with a key and evolve it using chaotic maps and HTM learning.
        Ensure that the evolved key is as expected and functions properly in encryption and decryption.

    SharedState Synchronization
        Simulate sender and receiver nodes and synchronize their states using SharedState.
        Validate that both nodes are operating with the same set of temporal keys at any given time.

    ComplexKey Method Orchestration
        Use the evolve method of the ComplexKey to apply multiple encryption techniques in sequence.
        Decrypt using the corresponding techniques and ensure data integrity.

    Full Pipeline Test
        Simulate a complete end-to-end encryption and decryption process, covering all modules and components.
        Validate the decrypted data and ensure it matches the original input.

    Attack Simulation
        Simulate common attack vectors like brute-force, time desynchronization, etc., and ensure the system can resist them.

    Performance Metrics
        Measure the speed, computational overhead, and other performance metrics during these integration tests to ensure they meet the expected benchmarks.
