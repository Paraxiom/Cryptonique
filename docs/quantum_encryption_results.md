# Temporal Key System Tests Overview

This document outlines the results and procedures of the tests conducted on the Temporal Key system in the cryptographic library. The tests aim to ensure the correct functioning of key evolution in both regular and quantum-safe manners.

## Test Descriptions

### `test_key_evolution`

- **Objective**: To test the basic mechanism of evolving a key using regular methods.
- **Process**:
  - Generated a high-entropy key.
  - Evolved this key using the `evolve_key` method over 10 iterations.
- **Result**:
  - Verified that the evolved key is different from the initial key, confirming the proper functionality of the key evolution process.

### `test_quantum_key_evolution`

- **Objective**: To test the quantum-safe evolution of the Temporal Key.
- **Process**:
  - Started with an initial key of all zeros.
  - Used the `quantum_evolve_key` method.
  - Process included initializing qubits using FFT, applying HTM learning, running Deutsch's Algorithm, encrypting with a Feistel Network, applying confusion and hashing, and a final HTM learning step.
- **Result**:
  - Confirmed that the evolved key is different from the initial key, ensuring the quantum key evolution process is functioning correctly.

### `test_temporal_key_evolution`

- **Objective**: To conduct a comprehensive test covering the entire key evolution process.
- **Process**:
  - Involved generating initial keys, initializing an HTM model and a shared state.
  - Evolved the key using HTM and quantum operations.
  - Validated the evolved key.
  - Ensured robustness against common cryptographic attacks.
- **Result**:
  - Confirmed the effectiveness of the key evolution process, including quantum enhancements, in evolving and validating the key while ensuring its robustness.

## Conclusion

The successful execution of these tests indicates that the Temporal Key system is functioning correctly. It is capable of evolving keys in both regular and quantum-safe manners, ensuring their validity and resistance against common cryptographic attacks. The detailed logs from the tests provide a clear understanding of the internal workings and steps involved in the key evolution process.
